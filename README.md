## permutation-test-for-ERP

This RMD file contains a function to perform permutations tests and the consecutive tests for two ERP components from our last study (Rashal et al., in revision, AP&P).
The test follows the logic in Hickey et al, (2019), but see Sawaki et al. (2012) for another approach.
The file is knitted into html.
